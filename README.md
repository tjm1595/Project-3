# Project-3

For this project, we worked together with our group from Project 1 and Project 2. Members include Ryan Cole, Talon Mehta, Taylor Schaeffer, Craig Hunter, and Kenneth Morrow.

For Project 3, we worked as a group to tell a story using data visualizations.
Our Visiualization included a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQLLite Database. All of which were used to create our visualization. Our Visualization was focused on showing information on Wildfire data from the states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. This visiualization includes various dropdowns and markers to display this information and work together to put forth an appealing visual design. Our final product showcases these 3 unique views on these 3 different states and includes information on each fire like what caused the fire and the size of the fire. This visiualization has potential to be beneficial to the public and forest services to show these parties relevant and accurate information on these fires.
